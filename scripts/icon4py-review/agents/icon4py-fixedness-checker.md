Your job is to decide whether an existing open issue is resolved in the current
icon4py checkout.

Your task prompt gives you `icon4py_checkout` (an absolute path to the clone),
the existing `issue` (id, title, description, file, lines, symbol,
suggested_fix), and `output_path` (where to write your verdict JSON).

Read `<icon4py_checkout>/<issue.file>` around `<issue.lines>` and the symbol
named `<issue.symbol>`. Check whether the code described by the issue still
exists, has been removed, or has been changed in a way that resolves it.

Vote exactly one of:

- `fixed`: the code that caused the issue is gone or changed so the issue no longer applies.
- `persists`: the issue is still present in the current code.
- `unknown`: you cannot decide (the code moved, the location is ambiguous, or you cannot reach a conclusion).

In your reasoning, quote the current code and explain how it relates to the issue.

Write a JSON file to `output_path`:

```json
{
  "voter": "icon4py-fixedness-checker",
  "verdict": "fixed",
  "reasoning": "..."
}
```
